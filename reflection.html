							<p>Assignment 1</p>
							<p>I have learnt a lot from this assignment because it provided valuable understanding of various ICT (Information and Communication Technology) jobs related to network and computing. Recognizing the importance of technology in our fast-paced world and understanding the demand for ICT jobs underscores the significance of these roles in shaping and sustaining modern society.</p>
							<p>Besides, it helped us realize that awareness of the specific skills required for ICT jobs is crucial, as technology continues to advance rapidly, necessitating professionals who can adapt and contribute to these changes. This insight can guide individuals in pursuing relevant education and training to meet the demands of the industry.</p>
							<p>Lastly, it helped me understand the differentiation between internship and work life highlights an essential aspect of professional development. Internships often serve as a learning experience, allowing individuals to gain practical knowledge and skills in a real-world setting. On the other hand, work life involves applying the acquired computing knowledge to contribute to the development and maintenance of websites, software, and other technological solutions.</p>
							<p>In my opinion, lecturers should provide hands-on experience for students. Exposure to hands-on activities prepares students for the challenges they might face in a professional ICT environment. It helps them become familiar with the tools and workflows commonly used in the industry. By working with different software applications, students can explore various aspects of ICT jobs. This exploration can help them identify specific areas of interest and potential career paths within the broader field of technology.</p>

							<p>Assignment 2</p>
							<p>From the Industrial Talk of UTM Digital and our visit at UTM Digital, I learnt that there are four distinct departments within UTM Digital, which are Digital Services UTM KL, Division of Digital Strategy, Division of Digital Architecture, Division of Digital Innovation. On top of that, I have gained insights into how UTM Digital is responsible for enhancing the provision of high-quality ICT services through cutting-edge technology.</p>
							<p>Fundamentally, UTM ID authentication streamlines the process of user access to UTM services. By verifying users through a standardized identification process, it minimizes delays and ensures a smooth and efficient login experience. Additionally, UTM providing official gmail addresses is convenient for students to stay connected with the university and receive important information regarding events and announcements. Moreover, offering free licensed software subscriptions like Microsoft 365 and NVIVO can greatly benefit students in their academic pursuits. It has ensured efficiency, reliability, security, and user satisfaction in the services offered.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, there is Digital Care department for students facing issues related to ICT (Information and Communication Technology) services. Not to mention by actively participating in industry collaborations, attending relevant courses, and staying abreast of technological advancements, UTM Digital is positioning itself to provide students and staff with a technologically advanced and innovative environment. This approach is crucial for fostering a culture of innovation and preparing students for the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital landscape.</p>
							<p>In my opinion, this visit is beneficial as students can learn about UTM services and plan for future innovations. However, the visit can be improved through extended Q&A sessions, feedback mechanism, longer interactive sessions and more detailed presentations. By focusing on these aspects, the visit can become a more enriching experience for students, fostering a deeper understanding of UTM services and promoting a collaborative and innovative mindset among the student community.</p>

							<p>Assignment 3</p>
							<p>Thanks to this Industrial Talk about System Development @ Credence, I managed to understand that system development, also known as software development or application development, refers to the process of creating and maintaining information systems, which can include software applications, websites, databases, and other types of technology-based solutions. The process of system development typically involves the following phases: Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance and Support. The goal of system development is to design, build, and deploy effective and efficient systems that meet specific business or organizational needs.</p>
							<p>On the other hand, the talk provided clear explanation about Credence, which appears to be a service-oriented company introduced by Teknologi Malaysia Berhad (TNB) with a focus on analytics and cloud services.Credence prides itself on fostering a collaborative team with open communication, continuous learning and growth, encouragement of empowerment and independence, and commemorating achievements and milestones. This insight provides a glimpse into the company's values and the work culture it cultivates.Credence has also formed significant partnerships with well-known technology companies such as VMware, AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Huawei. These partnerships are likely strategic alliances that empower Credence to offer a diverse range of options to its clients, leveraging the technologies and expertise of these partners.</p>
