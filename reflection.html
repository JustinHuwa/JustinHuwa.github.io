							<p>Assignment 1</p>
							<p>I have learnt a lot from this assignment because it provided valuable understanding of various ICT (Information and Communication Technology) jobs related to network and computing. Recognizing the importance of technology in our fast-paced world and understanding the demand for ICT jobs underscores the significance of these roles in shaping and sustaining modern society.</p>
							<p>Besides, it helped us realize that awareness of the specific skills required for ICT jobs is crucial, as technology continues to advance rapidly, necessitating professionals who can adapt and contribute to these changes. This insight can guide individuals in pursuing relevant education and training to meet the demands of the industry.</p>
							<p>Lastly, it helped me understand the differentiation between internship and work life highlights an essential aspect of professional development. Internships often serve as a learning experience, allowing individuals to gain practical knowledge and skills in a real-world setting. On the other hand, work life involves applying the acquired computing knowledge to contribute to the development and maintenance of websites, software, and other technological solutions.</p>
							<p>In my opinion, lecturers should provide hands-on experience for students during the virtual talk. Exposure to hands-on activities prepares students for the challenges they might face in a professional ICT environment. It helps them become familiar with the tools and workflows commonly used in the industry. By working with different software applications, students can explore various aspects of ICT jobs. This exploration can help them identify specific areas of interest and potential career paths within the broader field of technology.</p>

							<p>Assignment 2</p>
							<p>From the Industrial Talk of UTM Digital and our visit at UTM Digital, I learnt that there are four distinct departments within UTM Digital, which are Digital Services UTM KL, Division of Digital Strategy, Division of Digital Architecture, Division of Digital Innovation. On top of that, I have gained insights into how UTM Digital is responsible for enhancing the provision of high-quality ICT services through cutting-edge technology.</p>
							<p>Fundamentally, UTM ID authentication streamlines the process of user access to UTM services. By verifying users through a standardized identification process, it minimizes delays and ensures a smooth and efficient login experience. Additionally, UTM providing official gmail addresses is convenient for students to stay connected with the university and receive important information regarding events and announcements. Moreover, offering free licensed software subscriptions like Microsoft 365 and NVIVO can greatly benefit students in their academic pursuits. It has ensured efficiency, reliability, security, and user satisfaction in the services offered.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, there is Digital Care department for students facing issues related to ICT (Information and Communication Technology) services. Not to mention by actively participating in industry collaborations, attending relevant courses, and staying abreast of technological advancements, UTM Digital is positioning itself to provide students and staff with a technologically advanced and innovative environment. This approach is crucial for fostering a culture of innovation and preparing students for the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital landscape.</p>
							<p>From my perspective, this visit is beneficial as students can learn about UTM services and plan for future innovations. However, the visit can be improved through extended Q&A sessions, feedback mechanism, longer interactive sessions and more detailed presentations. By focusing on these aspects, the visit can become a more enriching experience for students, fostering a deeper understanding of UTM services and promoting a collaborative and innovative mindset among the student community.</p>

							<p>Assignment 3</p>
							<p>Thanks to this Industrial Talk about System Development @ Credence, I managed to understand that system development, also known as software development or application development, refers to the process of creating and maintaining information systems, which can include software applications, websites, databases, and other types of technology-based solutions. The process of system development typically involves the following phases: Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance and Support. The goal of system development is to design, build, and deploy effective and efficient systems that meet specific business or organizational needs.</p>
							<p>On the other hand, the talk provided clear explanation about Credence, which appears to be a service-oriented company introduced by Teknologi Malaysia Berhad (TNB) with a focus on analytics and cloud services. The company aims to support both private enterprises and the public sector in their digital transformation journey. Credence has also formed significant partnerships with well-known technology companies such as VMware, AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Huawei. These partnerships are likely strategic alliances that empower Credence to offer a diverse range of options to its clients, leveraging the technologies and expertise of these partners. Credence even prides itself on fostering a collaborative team with open communication, continuous learning and growth, encouragement of empowerment and independence, and commemorating achievements and milestones. This insight provides a glimpse into the company's values and the work culture it cultivates.</p>
							<p>In addition, I was given a clear understanding about various technologies and tools used in system development, such as Database and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), Visualization Tools, ELT/ETL Process, Programming Languages and Data Engineering. These technologies collectively form a stack that allows for the efficient development, analysis, and management of data within a system. The integration of visualization tools, ELT processes, and programming languages like SQL and Python suggests a comprehensive and modern approach to system development, particularly in the context of data-driven applications.</p>
							<p>In my view, the virtual industry talk is fine but there is major disappointment caused by the abrupt cancellation of several events. Therefore, it's essential for organizers and presenters to be aware of technical issues that may occasionally occur in virtual platforms and take measures to address them. This could involve testing connections in advance, using reliable technology, and having backup plans in case of unforeseen issues. Constructive feedback can also be valuable in enhancing the planning and execution of virtual events, ensuring a more positive experience for participants.</p>

							<p>Assignment 4</p>
							<p>From this assignment, I found out that there are challenges and ongoing issues related to the fresh vegetable shortage, even after the Movement Control Order (MCO) restrictions have been lifted. It appears that the persistent shortage is creating difficulties for both consumers and traders, leading to long queues at supermarkets and challenges in the transportation of vegetables. Consumers are facing the need to adhere to social distancing measures, resulting in prolonged waits at supermarkets to purchase essential groceries. Additionally, traders are encountering difficulties in transporting heavy crates of vegetables, exacerbated by limitations in labor availability, particularly due to dependencies on migrant workers. Therefore, citizens are urged to exercise self-control, proactively avoid crowded places, and manage traffic whenever possible. This collective effort is deemed necessary to adjust to the evolving circumstances surrounding the availability and accessibility of fresh vegetables.</p>
							<p>To overcome this issue, I was given a brief introduction about I-Farm. I-Farm appears to be a technology-driven solution that combines data analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT) for precision farming. Originating as a response to the 2020 Covid-19 vegetable shortage, I-Farm aims to address the issue by offering a variety of reference vegetables through e-commerce. The technology is designed to enhance productivity, control the supply chain, and minimize disruptions in the market. The key features of I-Farm include the ability for users to monitor the growing process, utilize environmentally friendly materials, and reduce dependence on pricier imported vegetables. On top of that, I-Farm has implemented self-collect service centers, particularly in condominiums to provide users with fresh and convenient access to the harvested produce.  This allows users to maintain the freshness of the vegetables while providing a convenient harvesting experience.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, the introduction of Smart Urban Farms (I-Farm) represents a cutting-edge solution to address the challenges in fresh vegetable availability. Envisioning the future of vegetable supply and distribution involves implementing several innovative approaches that leverage advanced technologies and sustainable practices. One key aspect is the introduction of a user-friendly AI platform for intuitive and predictive vegetable ordering. Additionally, advanced contactless delivery systems employing autonomous vehicles or drones could be utilized to ensure efficient and timely delivery of fresh vegetables, further enhancing the overall shopping experience. To ensure transparency and traceability in the supply chain, the adoption of blockchain technology is also suggested. In addition, community engagement and education are pivotal in this vision. Finally, building a resilient post-pandemic food system is highlighted as essential for  fostering a more sustainable and resilient food system for the future.</p>
							<p>Personally, I believe that the virtual talk has been helpful in understanding the countermeasures taken to address issues with fresh vegetable availability. Nevertheless, the talk cam be improved enhance the interactive element by allowing students to pick a type of vegetable and try out farming with the I-Farm app. This hands-on approach can offer practical experience, engage students more actively, and provide a tangible connection to the discussed solutions.</p>
